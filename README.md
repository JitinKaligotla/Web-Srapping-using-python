Hey, Hello everyone!.
We are doing web scraping on the website that I have provided. You don't need to install any python interpreters , You can run it on repl itself, But my 
advice is to run on vs-code. It works very well on vs code and Before running the code don't forget to install the  Selenium , requests package by using pip install method,
other are build in packages you don't need to worry.
Last advice from my side is don't waste your time by memorizing all the methods of all the data structures,
Just have a breif idea about python syntax and methods like where to use which method , Even if you don't remember just google it and you need to know python basics like syntax ,
functions , data structures.
Thank you , Happy learning
